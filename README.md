# Design Trek-P.E.R.C.Y
 Me and my fellow school mates were given the opportunity to attend the Design Trek Competition held at the National Institute of Design located in Kurukshetra, Haryana. We were accompanied by our school physics teacher Mr. Rajat Saxena. My team and I presented our project, Percyâ€”an amphibious vehicle designed to tackle flood emergencies in India.

It was truly inspiring to be surrounded by professionals in STEM and creative design and to receive valuable feedback from the esteemed panel. They were highly impressed with Percy and encouraged us to pursue this project seriously, which we are still actively refining and improving.

Beyond the ideathon, exploring the NID campus and witnessing the various workshops and innovative projects was an eye-opening experience. It gave me a new appreciation for the intersection of design and engineering in solving global challenges.

This experience has enhanced Percy and deepened my understanding of design thinking, teamwork, and innovation. I look forward to applying these learnings as we develop Percy into a solution that can make a real-world impact!
